                <h1>HISTORY</h1>
                <p>Tekken (Japanese: 鉄拳, "Iron Fist") is a fighting game franchise created, developed, and published by Namco(later Bandai Namco Entertainment). Beginning with the original Tekken in 1994, the series has received several sequels as well as updates and spin-off titles. Tekken was one of the first fighting games at the time to use 3D animation. The series has also been adapted into three films and other media. The series' official English name is always written in all-capital letters (TEKKEN, abbreviated to TK). There are six main installments to the series, one installment having an updated version that also made a home release, two non-canonical installments, and a seventh mainline game in the works.</p>
                <p>The premise of each game in the main series documents the events of the King of Iron Fist Tournament, hosted by the Mishima Zaibatsu corporation. The prize is typically control of the company, which then allows the winner to host the following tournament. After beating the game with each character, an ending cutscene is unlocked and usually one of the endings from each game becomes the continuation of the story into the following installment. The story has largely revolved around the Mishima clan curse, which began narratively with Heihachi Mishima throwing his son Kazuya Mishima from a cliff when he was 5 years old. Kazuya was nearly killed from the fall, but through the influence of the "Devil Gene" he survived and swore revenge to his father by the time of the King of Iron Fist Tournament.</p>
                <p>The second game and its sequel were considered breakthrough titles and among the greatest games of all time, the latter also being the second best selling fighting game to date. The series itself is the best selling fighting game franchise in history.<sup>[1]</sup></p>
                <h2>1994–98: PlayStation trilogy</h2>
                <h3>Tekken</h3>
                <p>The first game in the series, Tekken, was released in 1994, first as an arcade game and then as a port for the PlayStation in 1995.[4] The game featured eight playable characters, each with its own sub-boss and stage and theme. The PlayStation version featured remixes of the characters' themes, and also made the sub-bosses playable for a total of eighteen characters, including a costume swap for Kazuya (Devil Kazuya). In addition, a cutscene was unlocked when the player finishes arcade mode with each of the original eight characters. The canon ending of the game consisted of Kazuya exacting revenge on his father Heihachi Mishima, beating him in the tournament and tossing him off the same cliff that he was thrown off by Heihachi.</p>
                <h3>Tekken 2</h3>
                <p>Tekken 2 was released in 1995 in arcades and in 1996 for the PlayStation. A port was also made several years later for Zeebo. There were ten playable characters as well as fifteen to unlock, for a total of twenty-five characters. The home version featured four new modes that would become staples to the series, which were Survival, Team Battle, Time Attack, and Practice. The game once again featured remixes of the arcade versions' characters' themes, and a cutscene unlocked once the player completes the arcade mode. The canon ending of this game consisted of Heihachi surviving the fall, entering the King of Iron Fist Tournament 2 and defeating Kazuya, throwing him into an erupting volcano and reclaiming the Mishima Zaibatsu. During the events of the second King of Iron First Tournament, Kazuya fell in love with Jun Kazama.</p>
                <h3>Tekken 3</h3>
                <p>Tekken 3 was released in arcades and for the PlayStation in 1997 and 1998, respectively.<sup>[5][6]</sup> The game largely featured a new cast of characters, including the debut of staple main character Jin Kazama, the love child of Kazuya and Jun, as well as now-staple characters Ling Xiaoyu and Hwoarang, with a total of twenty-three characters. The home version included a new mode called Tekken Force, as well as the bonus Tekken Ball mode, and also included remixes to the characters' themes from the arcade version.

                <h3>Tekken Tag Tournament</h3>
                <p>Tekken Tag Tournament was the next installment, released in 1999 in arcades and as a Launch title for the PlayStation 2 in 2000. Although the game was non-canonical to the storyline, it was considered a major entry to the franchise. In contrast to previous titles, Tekken Tag Tournament features tag battles and included almost all of the Tekken characters in the series up until that point in time, for a total of 34 characters. The game ran on the same arcade board as Tekken 3, and thus saw major graphical upgrades when ported to the PlayStation 2. The home version once more featured remixes of the characters' themes from the arcade version, and also featured a bonus Tekken Bowl mode. A remastered version of the game, Tekken Tag Tournament HD, was included in the 2011 collection Tekken Hybrid,<sup>[7]</sup> which also contained a playable demo of Tekken Tag Tournament 2 and the film Tekken: Blood Vengeance.<sup>[8]</sup></p>

                <p>Tekken 4 is the fifth installment and the next canon game in the series, released in 2001 in arcades and 2002 for the PlayStation 2. Placing distinction on the story, the home version included a new Story mode which would unlock cutscenes when played, in contrast to previous installments in which such cutscenes were unlocked from playing the Arcade Mode. The game also harbored many gameplay revisions, including the ability for the player to move about before the round begins, as well as walled-stages. For the first time, the themes used in the arcade mode were the same ones put into the home version. There were 23 characters to choose from. The story revealed that Kazuya survived the fall into the volcano from 20 years prior, and enters the King of Iron First Tournament 4 to take back the Mishima Zaibatsu. In the canon ending, Kazuya loses to Heihachi and then his son Jin, and Jin defeats Heihachi afterwards, transforms into his Devil form, but refrains from executing Heihachi from seeing a vision of his mother, despite his desires to do so.</p>

                <h3>Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection</h3>
                <p>Although Tekken games normally sometimes saw updates to the arcade versions, Tekken 5 was the first installment in the series that saw a revision significant enough that it saw a retitle, which was Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection in 2005. The game was ported to the PlayStation Portable in 2006 and featured two new characters, Emilie "Lili" De Rochefort and Sergei Dragunov. The game also introduced a ranking system to the series. The home version featured new modes, such as Ghost Mode, Tekken Dojo Mode, and the two bonus modes, Gold Rush mode, and a revised version of the Tekken Bowl mode introduced in Tekken Tag Tournament. The Devil Within mode from the PlayStation 2 version however, was absent. Namco Bandai saw the fan demand for a console version and a port for the PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Network was released in 2007, in full 1080p HD.[11][12] The PlayStation 3 version also saw an update and was retitled Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection ONLINE marking the first time in the series that online play was featured. The PlayStation 3 version also made Jinpachi Mishima playable (but not online).</p>
                <h3>Tekken 6</h3>

In the Scenario Campaign ending, after being defeated by Heihachi's illegitimate son Lars Alexandersson (who suffered amnesia at one point during the Scenario Campaign), Jin Kazama is revealed to have wreaked havoc and waged war on the world to fill it with negative energy and generate a physical manifestation of Azazel, so that he himself can face and kill him. After the battle, Jin's body is found by Raven.</p>
